#UploadVR Workshop Notes

#####Direction

If a model is not positioned correctly where Z axis points forward, you can
adjust by building a parent model.  You would make the parent face to
appropriate direction with the model in the orientation you want, and use that
parent as the model.

#####UI
- use objects in the world that you can reach and touch
- ex: ninja game slashing at windows to make selections
