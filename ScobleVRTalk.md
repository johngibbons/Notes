# Robert Scoble VR Talk

##### Photogrammetry
- overlaying of high res images on scanned 3D environments - 1 pixel per inch

##### Google Tango
- scans the world in 3D and overlays imagery on top of it
- can tell what floor you are on
- builds a point cloud which can then be used to map things onto

##### Q&A
- believes more in AR than VR
- thinks mobile issues solved in 18 months
- mobile needs better GPU which is probably 3-4 years away
- WebVR is being led by porn industry, doesn't think it will keep up
- at least 9 companies investing in AR, 5 years for that
- too expensive currently to capture volumetric data (5 minutes in a cylinder
  for $25k)

##### VR vs. AR
- VR will be more for entertainment, journalism, social, gaming
- AR more for industry, replacement for screens, use at work and day to day
